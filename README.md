Word guess game

This is a word guess game. When you press a correct letter, it will be placed in the space where it belongs. When you press an incorrect letter, the letters will be logged under "Wrong Letters."  You will have 10 guesses. If you figure out the word before your guesses are up, you win the game and the program will add a number to your "Wins" count.  If you run out of guesses before you figure out the letter, you lose and the program will add a number to your "Losses" count. The game automatically starts over if you win or lose.
